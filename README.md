For this project, stock values from a CSV file will be shown using a dynamic data visualization dashboard created using D3.js. The dashboard shows the stock's performance over time using a responsive line chart included inside a 960x500 SVG element. Tooltips and filtering options based on stock names and date ranges allow users to interact with the chart. To assure readability and visual appeal, the design is stylized using CSS, and the implementation complies with current web development standards for cross-browser compatibility and accessibility.
